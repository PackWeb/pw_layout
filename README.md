## Branches

`master` is the main, default branch I use for new sites. It uses
[Dart Sass](https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass) and CSS Grid.

`compass` is an old branch that a few sites still use (I need to update them).
It uses the deprecated [Compass](http://compass-style.org/),
[Susy](https://www.oddbird.net/susy/) and
[Breakpoint](http://breakpoint-sass.com/).
